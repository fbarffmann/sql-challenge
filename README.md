# sql-challenge
This holds the materials for the Module 9 challenge.

The table schema for each of the six CSV files was created first and the CSV files were loaded into their corresponding SQL tables.

QuickDBD was used to create the Entity Relationship Diagram. There was some translation between Postgres SQL syntax and QuickDBD syntax. The DOCS section of QuickDBD was used here.

Class notes/discussions were used to complete the Data Analysis.
