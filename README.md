# Employee Data Analysis with PostgreSQL

Designed and queried a relational database to analyze employee records for a fictional company. Created a normalized schema, loaded data from CSV files, and used complex SQL queries to explore salary trends, department structures, and manager assignments.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
- Jupyter Notebooks
